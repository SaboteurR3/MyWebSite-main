                <p class="card-text">At the foot of the Rocky Mountains in British Columbia, The Emerald Lake Lodge is a great jumping off point for exploring nearby Banff National Park and Lake Louise. After a day on the slopes, warm up inside the lodge’s rustic hand-hewn timber interiors and enjoy a cognac at the salvaged 19th century Yukon saloon. The 24 cabin-style buildings embody the height of après sky luxury, with pillowy down duvets, wood burning stone fireplaces (stocked daily with firewood) and wraparound balconies with panoramic views of the frosty lake below.</p>

                    found on the north shore of Iceland’s Snæfellsnes Peninsula, only a short distance away
                    from the town of Grundarfjörður It is often called ‘the most photographed mountain in Iceland’. Kirkjufell looks straight out of a fairytale. This unusually shaped mountain is pretty
                    enough in the springtime, but becomes truly beautiful once it gets a layer of snow. It’s
                    a favorite subject of nature photographers, but it’s even better when seen in real life.
                    It is a small town with a population of just
                    900 people. </p>

The lake surrounds Bled Island, which houses several buildings, including a church that hosts a good number of weddings each year. In fact, it’s considered good luck for the groom to carry his wife up the 99 steps of the church’s tower to ring the bell at the top. During winter, the lake turns a frosty blue and reflects the surrounding snowy mountains on its surface. Visitors to the area can enjoy skiing, or visit the nearby Vintgar gorge, which is home to many waterfalls, pools, and caves.</p>

There are plenty of pull-offs on the highway to stop and snap pictures, or you can pay a fee to get up close. It’s the largest glacier accessible by car in the United States, stretching over 27 miles long and four miles wide, so it’s definitely worth the detour. </p>

The town looks beautiful in the summer, sure, but it's during the winter months that you get to view the Northern Lights during their peak season. If you're going to be freezing up in Scandinavia, you might as well get to cross an astronomical item off your bucket list.</p>

This enchanting Alpine village lies at the foot of the Matterhorn, Switzerland's most famous mountain, and has plenty of modern touches, like its state-of-the-art lift system and swanky après-ski diversions.</p>

                    <p class="card-text2">The islands of the Maldives are best experienced in the summertime when they have dry weather. There are nearly 1,200 islands along the Maldives archipelago, so there are many options for a tropical summer vacation. The draw of the islands are the deep blue seas, water sports, beautiful coral reefs, and tropical beaches.
                    The summer weather, with warm and dry conditions, enables you to spend the most time out exploring the islands and the Indian Ocean waters. The islands are surrounded by reefs, so the pleasant weather days make it nice to spend time in the water to see some of the spectacular reefs and aquatic life.</p>

                <p class="card-text2">A massive volcanic eruption around 1650 B.C. forced the center of what was then a single island to implode and succumb to the sea. Some say that this was the original home of the lost city of Atlantis, which long ago disappeared into the ocean's depths. Whatever remains of this mythological metropolis is now guarded by beautiful beaches and stately whitewashed homes. Today, Santorini consists of two inhabited islands and several islets. Most visitors spend their time on Thira (the archipelago's largest island), which is home to Santorini's major towns, including Fira and Oia. Sleepy Thirassia makes for a relaxing daytrip too. And don't count out the quieter islands: Nea Kameni and Palea Kameni are worth exploring.</p>

                    <p class="card-text2">Because of coral bleaching caused by climate change, you should visit Australia's Great Barrier Reef ASAP. Diving and snorkeling are still extremely scenic at hot spots like Osprey Reef and Heron Island. However, you don't have to be a diver to fully enjoy the Great Barrier Reef. Sailing the blue ocean and kicking back on one of the beautiful Whitsunday Islands beaches will no doubt satisfy relaxation seekers. You can also get to know some of Australia's animals at Wildlife Habitat Port Douglas and Hartley's Crocodile Adventures.</p>

                    <p class="card-text2">Summer features fewer rain showers than other seasons in the Peruvian mountains, plus daytime highs in the 60s. This pleasant weather means experienced hikers will have terrific conditions for trekking the Inca Trail. Non-hikers can still enjoy this iconic locale, but keep in mind that trail spots (and admission tickets) are limited and require reservations. Because of the incredible weather during this time of year, you should expect this UNESCO World Heritage Site and the nearby city of Cusco to be busier than usual.</p>

            <p class="paragraph">
              Camping is recreational activity in which participants take up temporary residence in the outdoors, usually using tents or specially designed or adapted vehicles for shelter. Camping was at one time only a rough, back-to-nature pastime for hardy open-air lovers, but it later became the standard holiday for vast numbers of ordinary families.
              The founder of modern recreational camping was Thomas Hiram Holding, who wrote the first edition of The Camper’s Handbook in 1908. His urge to camp derived from his experiences as a boy: in 1853 he crossed the prairies of the United States in a wagon train, covering some 1,200 miles (1,900 km) with a company of 300. In 1877 he camped with a canoe on a cruise in the Highlands of Scotland, and he made a similar trip the next year. He wrote two books on these ventures. Later he used a bicycle as his camping vehicle and wrote Cycle and Camp (1898).

                            <p>Even if you prefer slumbering under the stars, you should always have a tent or other emergency shelter on hand just in case. Otherwise, a midnight deluge, freak snowstorm or heavy dew is sure to leave you drenched, miserable and at risk of hypothermia. A tent can shield you and your gear from high winds as well. Whether you opt for the best two person tent or a larger cabin-style tent, make sure you bring along all of its necessary accessories: rope, tent poles, stakes and a rain fly.</p>

Keep in mind, too, that many insects are most active at night and may chance upon your unswaddled body. Going without a sleeping bag risks an uncomfortable night's sleep at best, exposure at worst.</p>

                            <p>Another important item is a lighter. Camping isn't camping without a warm, crackling campfire, so you'll want the tools to get one started quickly. Campers can start fires with a flint and steel, matches, a cigarette lighter or a magnesium fire starter. If you opt for matches, make sure they're waterproof. It's not a bad idea to pack two fire starters in case one fails. Take along a little kindling as well, like dry bark or strips of newspaper, in a waterproof container. Finding dry kindling when you need it can be a challenge in the outdoors.</p>

                            <h4>WATER BOTTLE</h4>
                            <p>Water is essential for survival in the great outdoors, and the further off the beaten path you go, the more quickly it seems to run out. The last thing any camper wants is to be stuck without a fresh supply of H2O, especially since drinking from a pond or lake can cause serious illness due to bacteria. Even if the wilderness you're heading into is just a few feet from your car, carry a day's supply of the wet stuff in a camelbak or other large container. Then, keep a filter or water purification tablets on hand in case you have to refill from a nearby stream.</p>

                            <h4>FIRST AID KIT</h4>
                            <p>It's unlikely you'll experience a life-threatening injury while camping, but even a long day of hiking can result in blisters that require bandaging. Small cuts and scrapes, too, can quickly become infected if left untreated, so keep bandages and antiseptic on hand. Your first aid kit should include other necessities as well: scissors, adhesive, gauze, soap, a CPR mouth barrier and an emergency whistle. Sunburn and bug bites can end your trip as quickly as any laceration.</p>

                            <h4>MAP AND COMPASS</h4>
                            <p>If your camping itinerary calls for hiking in remote areas, don't go without a map and compass or GPS. Constant changes in the sun's position can make forest landmarks seem unfamiliar, causing hikers to become disoriented. Unprepared campers have occasionally wandered the woods for days before getting rescued or finding their way back to camp. Getting lost or stranded in a wooded area, especially with a limited supply of water, is no joke.</p>

                            <h4>POCKET KNIFE</h4>
                            <p>The pocket knife is the ultimate multipurpose tool of the outdoors. A knife can be used to trim a rope, cut fishing line, dice bait, slice cheese or sausage, open a tightly sealed package, sharpen a stick, deal with tangled vines, tighten a screw or skin a small animal. Without a knife, such tasks become nearly to outright impossible. If you leave your knife at home, expect to feel frustrated–often.</p>

                            <p>Last item in our list is a FLASHLIGHT or lantern. A campfire may be nice and bright, but only for about six feet in any direction. If you need to locate an item within your tent or visit the latrine during the night, a portable, battery-powered light is invaluable. Many campers tout headlamps as the best option because of their hands-free functionality.</p>
